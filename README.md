## About this AMP

The CML Fine Tuning Studio is a Cloudera-developed AMP that provides users with an all-encompassing application and “ecosystem” for managing, fine tuning, and evaluating LLMs. This application is a launcher that helps users organize and dispatch other CML Workloads (primarily CML Jobs) that are configured specifically for LLM training and evaluation type tasks.

## High Level Feature

* Import datasets, models, model PEFT adapters, and other components into the Application's UI for easy tracking of project resources
* Design training prompt and inference prompt templates to be used to augment datasets for training, inference, and evaluation purposes
* Launch fine tuning jobs and MLFlow evaluation jobs directly from the UI, which in turn kicks off appropriate CML Workloads
* Locally compare generation results between different PEFT adapters for a given base model
